# flies-game
a little killing game written in python

It's about killing as many flies as possible in 90 seconds.
Just klick them.

Some different game ending backgrounds included. Just try:

- kill more than 80 flies per second
- kill no fly at all
- kill more than 3 butterflies

There are some unicode emojis inside, but I added no-unicode versions because on some ubuntu versions the game crashes even at startup.
I also added german translations to make my best friend play the game, too :-)

Have fun :-)
